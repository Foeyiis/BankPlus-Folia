1. Download [CMI-API](https://github.com/Zrips/CMI-API/releases/latest)
2. Create a directory in root called `libs` and drop the file in there.
3. Add the jar as a dependency for whatever IDE you're using.

   3a.  If using IntelliJ: *File > Project Structure > Modules > Dependencies > JARs or Directories*
4. Set the language level to 17
   
   4a.  If using IntelliJ: *File > Project Structure > Project > Language Level > 17*

That should be all.
